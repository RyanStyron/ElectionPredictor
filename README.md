Presidential election forecast designed by Ryan Styron (@RyanStyron) and James Wu (@jameswu05).

In development is an interface which provides users various methodologies to predict the
victor of a United States presidential election. Certain methodologies are variants of those
which have been practiced for decades, such as Allan Lichtman's *Keys to the White House*, while
others blend polling data and socioeconomic indicators.

As an extention to the forecast tool, U.S. congressional races will be able to be simulated, 
with other contests planned in the pipeline as well.
